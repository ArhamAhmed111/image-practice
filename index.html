<p>A luxury car is a car that provides above-average to high-end levels of comfort, features, and equipment. Often more expensive materials and surface finishes are used, and buyers expect better build quality. The usually higher pricing and more upscale appearance is often associated with higher social status of the users, compared to low and mid-market segment cars.

    The term is relative and partially subjective, reflecting both objective qualities of a car, as well as the projected and perceived image of the car marque.[1] Luxury brands rank above premium brands, though there is no clear demarcation between the two.[2]
    
    Traditionally, most luxury cars were large vehicles, though smaller sports-oriented models were always produced. "Compact" luxury vehicles such as hatchbacks, and off-road capable sport utility vehicles, are more recent expansions of luxury qualities in various cars.[1]
    
    Increasing (comfort) features, materials quality, interior space, innovations, and or performance have consistently been competitive strategies between car makers, practically throughout the history of the automobile.</p>

   <h4>European manufacturers</h4> 

       <p> Bugatti Royale (1927–1933)
        Prior to World War II, a wide array of European producers made luxury cars, including Rolls-Royce, Bugatti, Delage, Delahaye, Talbot-Lago, Bentley, Alvis, Avions Voisin, Isotta Fraschini, Horch, Simson, Stoewer, Maybach, Mercedes-Benz, Hispano Suiza, Daimler Company, and Spyker.[30][31]
        
        France was a leading producer of powerful luxury automobiles prior to World War II.[32] After World War II, the French government used puissance fiscale tax regulations to encourage manufacturers to build cars with small engines, and French motorists to buy them.[32] The Maserati-powered Citroën SM and the Citroën C6 were arguably the last domestic French luxury cars.[33][34] In the 2010s, some French manufacturers have attempted to develop luxury cars, however the lack of a historical legacy has hindered these efforts.[35] In 2014, Citroën introduced DS Automobiles sub-brand to market luxury cars.[36][37]
        
        Pre World War II intermediate car manufacturers like Renault, Fiat, Opel, Lancia, Škoda, Riley, Praga, Peugeot, Hillman and Tatra made luxury cars but were forced to make economy cars and superminis post World War II. Following World War II, Germany rose to become an export powerhouse, building on success with the Mercedes-Benz brand, later joined by BMW, which acquired Rolls-Royce Motor Cars in 1998, as well as Volkswagen which much later controlled or acquired additional brands such as Audi, Porsche, Bentley, Lamborghini, and Bugatti brands.[38][39]
        
        In the Soviet Union, the manufacturer ZiL (then called Zis) began producing representational limousines in the mid-1930s. In the early 1950s GAZ joined with the somewhat smaller "Chaika" model range.</p>
